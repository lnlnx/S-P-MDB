This is a demo project (design idea was taken from Spotify).

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have installed all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install (or npm install)
```

### Runing application

Below command will start a React application on port 3000 and a json-server on port 3001. (Make sure these two ports are not occupied before running the app!)
The json-server was used a mock api server for getting artist and album data.

```
yarn start
```
